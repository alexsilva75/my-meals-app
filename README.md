# my-meals-app
This project was developed in the course React Native - The Practical Guide 2020, taught by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller, from AcadeMind on the Udemy Platform. In this section, we are building an app that shows a set of recipes grouped by categories, the user then, can choose a category and see the related dishes and its recipes. In this part of the course we are focused on learning all about navigation, by using the Navigation APIs v4 and v5.
